# Morpheme Playground (Grades 3–6)

An interactive morphology tool for students learning about prefixes, roots, and suffixes.

## What it does

- Pick a **root/base** (e.g. *port* = carry, *struct* = build)
- Scroll and click to choose a **prefix** and **suffix**
- See the **word sum** and **combined word** update in real time
- Read the **word-part meanings** and a **kid-friendly definition**
- 30+ Latin and Greek roots included

## How to use

Just open `index.html` in a browser — no install, no build step, no dependencies.

## How to deploy

**Vercel:** Connect this repo — Vercel will auto-detect `index.html` and deploy instantly.

**GitHub Pages:** Go to Settings → Pages → Source: main branch, root folder → Save.

## How to embed in Weebly

Once deployed, add an **Embed Code** block to your Weebly page:

```html
